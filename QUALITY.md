# QUALITY

> Paths below are in `packages/graphcompose/` (the framework).

Rules the code must satisfy. `make check` enforces what a machine can; the rest is checked in
self-review before every PR.

## Design

- **SRP.** One module = one reason to change. One graph node per file.
- **DRY.** Second copy of logic → extract. Third copy is a defect.
- **Small units.** Files ≤ 200 lines (lint-enforced), functions ≤ 50 lines, cyclomatic
  complexity ≤ 10.
- **Dependency injection over globals.** Models, tools and clients are passed in (factory
  arguments), never imported as singletons. This is what makes graphs testable.
- **Pure core, effectful edges.** Business logic is pure; I/O (LLM, network, fs) sits at the
  boundary behind a small interface.
- **Names say intent.** `routeToolCall`, not `handle`. Booleans read as questions: `isFinal`,
  `hasToolCalls`. Full words; kept abbreviations: DTO, PII, MCP, RAG, JSON, CSV, CLI, URL, ID, API
  (and `id`, `url`, `llm` in code).
- **Naming grammar (#127)** for every public name: kind as the suffix (`MainRouter`,
  `CoderAgent`; DTOs are noun pairs — `FileRead` → `FileContent`), when + what for moments
  (`BeforeToolCallJudge`), `max…` for one limit and a `limits` object for several, enums for closed
  sets, one field name per meaning, `…Of` for getting something for a component,
  `<verb>(what).on(target)` for attaching, `…Repository` for storage contracts, values with units
  (`usd()`, `seconds()`), `override…` only for replacing what is inherited.
- **Example code before spec.** A new decorator or parameter enters a spec only after example code
  using it is agreed.
- **Refactor while green.** Only after tests pass; never mix refactor and behaviour change in
  one commit.

## Types — the code is fully typed

Types are documentation that the compiler checks. A reader must understand **what a variable
holds from its type**, not guess it from the name.

- **Every domain concept has a named type.** Object shapes → `interface`; unions, function
  types, mapped types → `type`. No anonymous object types in exported signatures, no
  `Record<string, unknown>` / `object` / bare `string` where a domain type exists.
  - ✗ `function run(cfg: { key: string; m: string }): Promise<string>`
  - ✓ `function run(config: ModelConfig): Promise<AgentAnswer>`
- **Generics for reusable abstractions.** Nodes, tool wrappers, result types, repositories,
  retry helpers are generic with constraints (`<TState extends object>`) — not copy-pasted per
  type and not widened to `unknown`. With more than one parameter, name them: `TState`,
  `TUpdate`, `TInput`, `TOutput`. See `src/graph/types.ts`.
- **Branded types for primitives that can be confused**: IDs, model slugs, thread ids, amounts.
  `type ModelId = Brand<string, "ModelId">` (`src/types/brand.ts`). The brand is applied once,
  at the validated boundary.
- **Discriminated unions for variants and outcomes**:
  `type ToolOutput<T> = { kind: "ok"; value: T } | { kind: "error"; error: ToolError }`.
  `switch` over `kind` is exhaustive (default branch assigns to `never`).
- **One source per shape — derive, don't duplicate**: a DTO class is its own type; inside the
  framework `z.infer<typeof Schema>`, `typeof FlowState.State`, `ReturnType`, `Parameters`,
  `Pick` / `Omit`.
- **Immutable by default**: `readonly` fields and `ReadonlyArray` for data; `as const` for
  literal tables.
- **Compiler settings are the floor**: `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. No `any`, no
  non-null `!`, no `as` except at a validated boundary (parsing / branding). Exported functions
  have explicit return types.
- **Data crossing a tool or MCP boundary are DTO classes** (`graphcompose/dto`): one field
  decorator per field, plain data, validated by the framework at the boundary (tool arguments and
  results, MCP server tools, workflow start input). Workflows never write zod.
- External input the framework parses itself (CLI, config, settings, model JSON output) is
  validated with **zod inside the framework**; inside the system, types are trusted.
- Errors: throw typed `Error` subclasses with context; never swallow. No `console.log` in `src/`.

## Agents (LangGraph)

- **The workflow file is the graph.** `@Workflow({ flow: [...] })` with `from().next()`,
  `from(Router).routes()`, `chain`, `nextParallel` / `join`, `batchParallel`, `catchError` and `node`
  (CLAUDE.md → The flow DSL); nodes are `@WorkflowStart`, `@Router`, `@Agent`, `@WorkflowAction`,
  `@WorkflowFinish`.
  Assembly rules run at assembly, before any model call, and report **all** violations at once
  (`GraphRuleError` with stable codes). A new rule gets a code and a test.
- **Config-driven.** Agents, models, thinking and caching live in the workflow's components
  (`@Agent`, `@Router`, `@Workflow`), assembled into the config and validated at startup; limits
  live in the workflow's `settings()` (`WorkflowSettings.builder().limits(...)`), not in config.
  Every chat model inherits `defaults.chat`; each router names its own `model`; guards use
  `defaults.router` (Jev). Model choice is config, never code. Reference: Wiki → Configuration.
- **`MODEL_MAX` is the only way to say "no output cap"** — never a magic large number.
- **Models come from model providers** (`@ModelProvider`, `graphcompose/models`, #151): each model
  is served by exactly one registered provider (`serves`); reasoning and caching are the
  provider's, a component may override them (`thinking`, `cache` until #152). Cache markers and
  every other provider-specific request field are set in one place, the provider's wire form
  (`toWireRequest`) — no provider-specific request code outside `src/models` / `src/llm`.
- **Settings must fit their models**: checked against the provider's capabilities at startup and
  by `gc check --models` (in `make check`), all problems at once; nothing is silently substituted.
- **Prompts are checked at assembly** (#199): every agent, router and route prompt is read
  (`promptUrls` eagerly) and its `{{variables}}` checked against `promptVariables` plus the runtime
  `{{item}}` — `[prompt.unknown-variable] file:line …`, `[prompt.missing-file]`, all at once, also by
  `gc check --prompts`. `promptVersion` hashes the rendered texts, never file paths.
- **Routers are isolated** (`src/routers`): input is plain text + options, output is a
  `RouteOutcome` union (`decided` | `failed`); they import only `config`, `finops`, `llm`, and the
  rest of the code imports them only via `src/routers/index.ts` — ESLint-enforced. Routers are
  tested on their own (`packages/graphcompose/tests/routers/`), the graph adapter separately.
- **`@Router` = how + what.** `prompt` / `promptUrls` say how to choose; `routes` say what each
  choice means (`{ prompt, target }`, the text required); `from(Router).routes()` in the flow takes
  exactly those targets. A route
  **to a workflow finish** is worded as a stop instruction ("Stop and send the answer: …") — worded as
  "the answer is ready", Jev kept sending the turn back to the last agent (#116).
- **A router failure fails the run** (`RouterDecisionError`: `router.failed`,
  `router.unknown-route`) — no guessing, no fallback route; its spend is kept.
- **Classification is not generation**: routing, guards and detection use a decision model
  (Jev) — calibrated probabilities over fixed options; chat models produce content.
- State is declared once (`src/graph/flow-state.ts`, `Annotation.Root`). Nodes are typed with
  `SyncNode` / `AsyncNode<TState, TUpdate>` and return only the keys they own.
- Models are created only behind `ModelGateway` (the registry asks it; the default gateway asks the
  model providers) and injected; tests inject scripted models or fakes through the same gateway.
- Prompts live in `src/prompts/` (agents, graph) and `src/routers/prompts.ts` (routers own their
  prompts to stay isolated). No prompt strings inside nodes.
- Tools: `input` / `output` DTO classes (`*.dto.ts`), tested standalone (`toolOf(new Tool(fakes))`)
  before being wired into a graph. Agents run the framework's own loop (`src/graph/agent-loop/`) —
  no `createAgent`, no middlewares; side-effecting tools use `ctx.callId` as their idempotency key.
- **Bound every loop**: a router's `maxVisits` (required on every router on a cycle —
  `router.unbounded-cycle`), the run's steps limit (`limits.perRun.steps` —
  visits of agents and routers, default (agents + routers) × 3), and LangGraph `recursionLimit` only
  as a safety net far above the steps.

## FinOps

- **Every LLM call is accounted.** Each node that calls a model appends a `UsageRecord`
  (caller, model, tokens, USD) via `recordUsage`. An untracked model call is a defect.
- **Prefer reported cost over estimates**: a provider with `ModelCost.fromResponse()` (OpenRouter,
  Jev) reports each call's exact cost (`costSource: "api"`); otherwise tokens × its price table
  (`ModelCost.fromPrices`, `costSource: "price-table"`). A call with neither fails.
- **Limits per workflow** in its `settings()`:
  `.limits({ perRun: { steps: 12, cost: usd(0.1) }, perDay: { cost: usd(1) } })` (values with
  units, `graphcompose/units`).
  - `perDay.cost` — USD the workflow (`config.name`) may spend per UTC day; the counter resets at
    00:00 UTC. Spend is kept in a ledger outside the repo (`SPEND_LEDGER_DIR`, default
    `~/.langgraph-agents/spend/<workflow>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl`) and written call by call while the
    run streams, so a crashed run's spend still counts.
  - `perRun.cost` — USD one run may spend; `perRun.steps` — visits of agents and routers.
  - Every limit is checked before each agent or router visit. Hitting one **fails the run** —
    never a quiet stop — with `LimitExceededError` naming the boundary key
    (`limits.perRun.steps`, `limits.perRun.cost`, `limits.perDay.cost`,
    `routers.<name>.maxVisits`), the path and the spend so far.
  - Each run **reserves** its budget (`perRun.cost` ∩ what is left of the day) before its first
    call; spend shrinks the hold, the end (or a pause) releases the rest. Concurrent runs sharing a
    ledger in one process see each other's holds, so together they never pass `perDay.cost` — a run
    that finds nothing left fails with `limits.perDay.cost` before any call. `perDay.cost` therefore
    **requires** `perRun.cost`: without it the app fails at start with `[limits.per-run-required]`.
    Holds are per process: several processes on one file ledger are not coordinated.
  - Cost limits are soft by one call (a call in flight cannot be stopped). With `MODEL_MAX` one
    call is bounded only by the model.
  - A provider's fallback (`circuitBreakerPolicy.fallback`) maps each used model to its own
    (`fallbackModels`, checked at startup: `model.fallback-unmapped` / `model.fallback-no-price`);
    a fallback call is sent and recorded as that model, at the fallback's prices.
- **Caching is accounted**: cached input is priced at `cacheReadPerMTok` / `cacheWritePerMTok`
  (fallback: input price); `CostReport.cacheReadTokens` shows how much caching saved.
- **Right-size models**: the cheapest capable model for routing/classification; expensive
  models only for agents that need them; thinking only where it pays off.
- **Every run returns a `CostReport`** (total, calls, per caller); the CLI prints it. New
  cost-relevant behaviour gets a test asserting the accounting.
- **$0 test suite**: unit tests use fake models; real calls only in `make smoke`.
- Per-call inspection (latency, tokens, prompts): LangSmith tracing via env, no code changes.

## Tests

- **Coverage ≥ 80%** lines / branches / functions / statements (enforced).
- Tests never hit a real LLM or network. Whole workflows: `testWith(Workflow)` from
  `graphcompose/testing` (scripted models, stubbed MCP servers, blocked network, matchers by class);
  units: `FakeListChatModel` / `FakeStreamingChatModel` from `@langchain/core/utils/testing`.
- Compile-time tests: `// @ts-expect-error — <reason>` lines in a `*.test.ts`, checked by `tsc`.
- Real-model checks go to `tests/smoke/` and run only via `make smoke`.
- Each spec test case → one test. Name tests by behaviour:
  `it("returns a fallback answer when the model output is empty")`.
- Arrange / Act / Assert, one behaviour per test, no logic in tests.
- Required per ticket: happy path, edge cases from the spec, regression for touched behaviour.
