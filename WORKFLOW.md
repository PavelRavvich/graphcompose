# WORKFLOW

How work moves from a requirement to accepted code.

## Where things live — no specs, plans or docs as files in the repo

| Kind of knowledge                                       | Place                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Work items, discussion, **specs, implementation plans** | GitHub Issues of this repo (body + comments)     |
| **Stage of every ticket**                               | GitHub Project board of the repo, field `Status` |
| How the system works now                                | **GitHub Wiki** of this repo                     |
| Why a significant decision was made                     | Wiki pages `ADR-NNNN-Title`                      |
| Rules                                                   | `QUALITY.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`         |

- Issue and PR bodies are passed to `gh` via stdin (`--body-file -`), never through files.
- The Wiki is a separate git repo; its working copy is `../<repo>.wiki`, managed by
  `scripts/wiki.sh` (`pull`, `publish`, `seed`).
- Board and stages are managed by `scripts/ticket.sh` (`setup`, `status`, `list`, `sub`).

## The conveyor

| Stage (board `Status`) | Set by                          | Means                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Triage**             | `triage` skill                  | business side clarified: why, what it does, what it does not, constraints, acceptance criteria AC1… |
| **Backlog**            | `spec-session` skill            | spec, implementation plan, tests and manual checks mapped to every business AC                      |
| **In progress**        | `implement` skill (start)       | branch exists, work under way                                                                       |
| **Test**               | `implement` skill (after merge) | merged to `dev`, manual acceptance instructions posted on the issue                                 |
| **Done**               | **a human only**                | accepted; the human also closes the issue                                                           |

- Every skill moves the ticket to its own stage when it finishes.
- Triage and spec are **quiz-driven** (`.claude/skills/QUIZ.md`) and run in parallel sessions:
  every question restates the ticket, an example situation and the price of each option.
- Implementation runs independent tickets in parallel (worktrees + sub-agents, or Claude Code on
  the web), dependent ones in order.
- A ticket that cannot proceed gets the label `blocked` and a comment (what is known, what blocks,
  what is needed); its stage does not change.
- Large work: a parent issue (`type:epic`) with sub-issues (`scripts/ticket.sh sub`).

## Labels

`type:feature` · `type:bugfix` · `type:chore` · `type:epic` · `prio:mvp` · `prio:stretch` ·
`blocked`. Stages are **not** labels — they are the board `Status`.

## Branch model

```
production  ← released code
   ↑ PR
staging     ← pre-release verification
   ↑ PR
dev         ← integration branch; all work branches start and end here
   ↑ PR (squash)
<type>-<issue>
```

- Work branches are created from `dev` and merged back into `dev` via PR.
- Promotion `dev → staging → production` is a release activity, done by PR, never by the agent.
- Nobody pushes directly to `dev`, `staging`, `production`.

## Branch naming

`<type>-<issue>` — e.g. `feature-12`, `bugfix-13`, `chore-14`. Nothing else in the name.

## Commits

Conventional commits with the issue number: `feat(#12): …`, `fix(#13): …`, `test(#12): …`,
`chore(#14): …`. Small commits are fine; the PR is squash-merged.

## Pull requests

- Base: `dev`. Title: `<type>-<issue>: <issue title>`.
- Body follows `.github/pull_request_template.md` and says **`Refs #<issue>`** — never `Closes`:
  merging must not close the issue, because acceptance happens in Test.
- One PR per issue. No drive-by changes outside the issue scope — open a new issue instead.
- Merge: squash, delete branch, after `make check` / CI is green.

## Definition of Done (for the agent: ready for Test)

- [ ] Every business acceptance criterion (AC) is proven by a passing test or a manual check
- [ ] All automated acceptance criteria are tests, and they pass
- [ ] `make check` green (types, lint, format, coverage ≥ 80%)
- [ ] Self-review against `QUALITY.md` done
- [ ] "Wiki to update" applied and published (ADR page if a significant decision was made)
- [ ] PR merged to `dev`; ticket moved to **Test**; handoff comment with the manual acceptance
      checklist posted on the issue
- [ ] **Crucial Rule:** The GitHub CI must pass successfully (green) before starting any work on the next ticket. We do not accumulate CI problems or technical debt.

**Done** is the human's call after the manual checklist passes.

## Tool Call Approvals (Channels)

The `@Channel` decorator provides a unified way to handle human-in-the-loop and out-of-band tool call approvals. It decouples the workflow's business logic from the specific mechanism (CLI, Slack, Webhooks, gRPC) used to obtain the approval.

### 1. Define a Channel

A channel is a class that implements `ChannelHandler`: `requestApproval(req)` is called once each
time a run pauses at one of its tools (`req`: `runId`, `agentName`, `toolName`, `toolArguments`,
`metadata`). The container creates it, so it takes `deps` like a tool. An optional `inboundAdapter`
(`@InboundChannelAdapter`) turns the reply your channel receives (a button click, a webhook body)
into the decision.

<!-- snippet-context
import { Injectable } from "graphcompose";
@Injectable()
export class SlackClient {
  post(_text: string): Promise<void> {
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
}
-->

```typescript file=channels.ts
import {
  Channel,
  InboundChannelAdapter,
  type ChannelHandler,
  type ChannelRequest,
} from "graphcompose";

@InboundChannelAdapter({ name: "slack-click" })
export class SlackClick implements InboundChannelAdapter<{ action: string; user: string }> {
  interpret(click: { action: string; user: string }) {
    return Promise.resolve({ approved: click.action === "approve", by: click.user });
  }
}

@Channel({ name: "slack_approval", inboundAdapter: SlackClick, deps: [SlackClient] })
export class SlackChannel implements ChannelHandler {
  constructor(private readonly slack: SlackClient) {}

  requestApproval = (req: ChannelRequest): Promise<void> =>
    this.slack.post(`Approve ${req.toolName} for run ${req.runId}?`);
}
```

### 2. Attach the Channel to a Tool

Set `channel` on `@Tool` / `@McpTool` to the channel class, and list the class in
`@Workflow({ channelClasses })`. Every call of that tool pauses the run before the tool runs.

<!-- snippet-context
import { Tool, type ToolHandler } from "graphcompose";
import { Text } from "graphcompose/dto";
import { SlackChannel } from "./channels.js";
class DeleteUser {
  @Text() userId!: string;
}
class Deleted {
  @Text() userId!: string;
}
-->

```typescript
@Tool({
  name: "delete_user",
  description: "Deletes a user account.",
  input: DeleteUser,
  output: Deleted,
  channel: SlackChannel, // calls wait for an approval through SlackChannel
})
export class DeleteUserTool implements ToolHandler<DeleteUser, Deleted> {
  run({ userId }: DeleteUser): Promise<Deleted> {
    return Promise.resolve({ userId }); // runs only once the call is approved
  }
}
```

### 3. Provide Metadata and Execute

When starting the graph, you can pass string context (like user ID, tenant, etc.) using the `metadata` parameter. This metadata is passed to the `requestApproval` method of your channel, and tools and actions read it as `ctx.run.metadata` (its resume keeps it).

<!-- snippet-context
import type { App, WorkflowStartClass } from "graphcompose";
declare const app: App;
declare const ChatStart: WorkflowStartClass;
-->

```typescript
const result = await app.execute(
  ChatStart,
  { text: "Delete user 123" },
  { metadata: { approverEmail: "admin@example.com" } },
);
```

### 4. Resume the Run

The paused run's result carries its `thread`. Once the reply arrives out-of-band (e.g., the user
clicks "Approve" in Slack), resume that thread with it. With an `inboundAdapter`, pass the raw reply
and the adapter turns it into the decision; without one, pass a `ChannelDecision`. `gc chat` asks in
the terminal and resumes by itself.

<!-- snippet-context
import type { App, WorkflowStartClass } from "graphcompose";
declare const app: App;
declare const ChatStart: WorkflowStartClass;
-->

```typescript
const paused = await app.execute(ChatStart, { text: "Delete user 123" });

// Through the channel's adapter: the raw reply
await app.resume(paused.thread, { action: "approve", user: "admin@example.com" });

// Without an adapter: the decision itself
await app.resume(paused.thread, {
  approved: false,
  by: "admin@example.com",
  feedback: "Please double check the user ID, 123 belongs to the CEO.",
});

// Approve but override the arguments (bypassing the LLM)
await app.resume(paused.thread, {
  approved: true,
  by: "admin@example.com",
  overrideArguments: { userId: "456" }, // Corrected argument!
});
```

### Important Concepts

- **Override Arguments**: If the user modifies the tool arguments during the approval step, returning `overrideArguments` in the decision will inject those modified arguments straight into the tool, bypassing the LLM.
- **Timeouts and Rejections**: Channels are asynchronous fire-and-forget mechanisms. If a run should timeout, use an external cron job or scheduler to call `app.resume(thread, { approved: false, by: "scheduler", feedback: "Timeout" })`.
- **Durable pauses**: by default paused runs live in memory (`MemorySaver` checkpointer and an in-memory paused-run repository) and are lost on restart — dev and tests only. In production give both a durable checkpointer and the SQLite paused-run repository (the Tern database): `createApp(W, { stores: { checkpointer }, pausedRuns: createSqlitePausedRunRepository() })`.
- **Resume across deployments**: each pause stores the workflow version and config hash it paused under. Resuming it on an app with another config hash throws `IncompatibleResumeError` (naming both versions) unless the workflow accepts it: `WorkflowSettings.builder().onIncompatibleResume(({ paused }) => paused.workflowVersion === "1.0.0" ? "resume" : "reject")`. A rejected resume leaves the run paused.
