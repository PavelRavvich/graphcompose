/**
 * `graphcompose/internal` — the framework internals the `gc` CLI (packages/graphcompose-cli) is built
 * on (#205): environment and model checks, describe data, golden sets, replay, the template renderer.
 *
 * Not public API: no semver promise, and examples and projects may not import it (the lint allowlist
 * is the public entries only). Its API report (api/graphcompose-internal.api.md) shows the CLI's
 * contract in review. The CLI depends on the exact same `graphcompose` version: they ship together.
